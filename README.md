## Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm commonly used in machine learning and deep learning for finding the minimum of a function. It is particularly useful for minimizing the cost function in training neural networks.

### How it Works

1. **Initialization:** The algorithm starts by initializing the parameters or weights of the model with some arbitrary values.

2. **Compute the Gradient:** It then computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. The gradient represents the direction of steepest ascent.

3. **Update Parameters:** The algorithm updates the parameters by taking steps proportional to the negative gradient, thereby moving in the direction of steepest descent. This step is repeated iteratively to find the minimum of the cost function.

4. **Learning Rate:** The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps taken during each iteration. It determines how quickly or slowly the algorithm converges to the minimum. A high learning rate may cause the algorithm to overshoot, while a low learning rate may lead to slow convergence.

5. **Convergence:** The algorithm continues iterating and updating the parameters until it reaches a stopping condition, typically when the change in the cost function or the parameters falls below a certain threshold.

### Types of Gradient Descent

1. **Batch Gradient Descent:** In this variant, the algorithm computes the gradient using the entire training dataset. It requires more computational resources but can converge to the global minimum if the cost function is convex.

2. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):** SGD updates the parameters for each training example individually, making it faster and more scalable. However, the stochastic nature introduces more randomness, and the algorithm may oscillate around the minimum.

3. **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent:** This approach is a compromise between Batch Gradient Descent and SGD. It computes the gradient using a subset or mini-batch of training examples. It combines the advantages of both methods, providing a balance between efficiency and stability.

### Advantages and Limitations

Advantages of Gradient Descent:
- It is a widely used and effective optimization algorithm.
- It can handle large-scale problems by using variants like Stochastic Gradient Descent or Mini-Batch Gradient Descent.
- It can optimize a wide range of differentiable cost functions.

Limitations of Gradient Descent:
- It can get stuck in local minima if the cost function is non-convex.
- It may require careful tuning of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate.
- It might be slow to converge if the cost function has flat regions or narrow valleys.

Gradient Descent is a fundamental concept in machine learning, and understanding it is crucial for practitioners working in the field.
